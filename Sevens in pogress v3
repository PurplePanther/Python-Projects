##FOR REFERENCE
#pop() needs an index, need to pop index 0 and 1

#this has nothing to do with anything
#np.arange(-10,10)

#Why are things being duplicated on the last turn?

#I think I know what's wrong
#9H got popped off so //'8H' in played and '9H' not in playableCards// became true so it added another 9H
#Then because //if '9H' in played and '10H' not in playableCards:// was true it added 10H
#if 8 in played and 9 in played and 10 not in playable add 10H
#Yeah, I need 8 AND 9 BUT NOT 10

#How to check if suit is done? What happens after 10 or 5?

#How to check if all 

#i need to wrap back to first index once all plays are over
#how does?

##on dealing the cards
#if len(allCards) % len(playerHands != 0:
    #need to wrap around to start of player list and give players the 24 % players remaining cards
    #how to wrap back around to the first index?
    
##STUFF FOUND OUT
#array[-x:] = start from xth-last element, go to end
#reverse of x[0:] which is start at 0 and go to end
#NOTE: e.g. [-5:-1] starts at 5th-last, goes to second-last
#index number vs order number: 5th last value is 4th last index
